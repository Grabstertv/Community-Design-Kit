**Community Design Kit** is a community-driven resource repository containing high-resolution design assets. Each asset follows a basic naming convention and is organized for easy use by designers.

# How to Use
You have two options:
1. **Download Entire Repository**: Click `Code > Download ZIP` to keep a local copy. Note that new additions won't be reflected unless you download again.
2. **(Recommended)**: Use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop). This way, you can easily update by clicking "Pull origin" when new assets are added.

# How to Contribute
To contribute, submit a pull request for any additions or fixes. Follow these guidelines:

### File Naming Convention
Use the following naming structure for new assets:

```
Object/Shape - Action/Direction (Style) {Color/Size/Version} - Optional Info
```

**Example**: A red arrow pointing 90Â° in a thin illustrated style would be named:

```
Arrow - Right Bottom (Thin) {Red} - Illustrated
```

### Image Resolution
- **Minimum size**: Keep file sizes above 200px to ensure possible upscaling. Icons or Emojis should be in SVGs where possible.
- **No maximum size** has been set yet to optimize storage, but avoid excessively large files.

### Upscaled Images
If you're submitting upscaled images, ensure they are free of artifacts. You can use tools like [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/), but ensure the correct model is applied.

### Recommended Resources for Upscaling:
- [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/): Free multi-platform AI upscaler.
- [Restoring Ruined Screenshots](https://youtu.be/5t6h2AhhSO8?si=wNqq8DSq5KvFmn29): A detailed tutorial by Taran Van Hemert.

## Folder Structure
There is no set folder structure currently. However, if a category exceeds 10 files (e.g., emojis), create a folder that describes the type within its relevant parent folder.

## PNG Padding
Ensure that PNG files are free of unnecessary padding or empty space around the visible content to avoid cropping issues.
