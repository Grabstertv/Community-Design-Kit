This way, you can easily update by clicking "Pull origin" when new assets are available for download.
2. **Download Entire Repository**: Click `Code > Download ZIP` to keep a local copy. Note that new additions won't be reflected unless you download again.

# How to Contribute
To contribute, clone the [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) and [follow these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request-from-github-desktop#creating-a-pull-request) to submit a pull request. Your pull request will be accepted based on the follow these guidelines to keep things organized:

### File Naming Convention
While not a strict requirement, using the following naming structure for your files will ensure efficient searchability for everyone.

```
Object/Shape - Action/Direction (Style/Type) {Size,Additional Info}
```

**Example 1**: A red arrow pointing 90Â° in a thin illustrated style would be named:

```
Arrow - Right Bottom (Thin) {Red, Illustrated}
```
**Example 2**: Front facing Michael from GTA V with transparency.
```
Michael - Front facing (GTA V) {Transparent}
```

### Image Resolution
- **Minimum size**: Keep file sizes above 200px to ensure possible upscaling. Icons or Emojis should be in SVGs where possible.
- **No maximum size** has been set yet to optimize storage, but avoid excessively large files.

### Upscaled Images
If you're submitting upscaled images, ensure they are free of artifacts. You can use tools like Upscayl, but ensure the correct model is applied.

### Recommended Resources for Upscaling:
- [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/): Free multi-platform AI upscaler.
- [Restoring Ruined Screenshots](https://youtu.be/5t6h2AhhSO8?si=wNqq8DSq5KvFmn29): A detailed tutorial by Taran Van Hemert.

### Folder Structure
There is no set folder structure currently. However, if a category exceeds 10 files (e.g., emojis), create a folder that describes the type within its relevant parent folder.

### PNG Padding
Ensure that PNG files are free of unnecessary padding or empty space around the visible content to avoid cropping issues.

### Licensing
Keep copyright laws in mind when contributing. Make sure any assets you contribute are allowed to be shared and used publicly.

# Copyright
All logos and assets belong to their respective owners. Owner of this repository and contributors do not claim ownership over any content added to the repository.
